## Enhanced Editor

### Options Window

**View** > **Enhanced Editor**

**Tools** > **Options** > **Enhanced Editor...**

### General Tab

It is suggested to check _Show line numbers_. The margins become slightly wider, so this also makes highlighting blocks of code easier.

### Appearance Tab

This tab allows you to create schemes for your code with customized colors, font, and font size. Save your scheme by clicking _Save As..._ and providing a name.

**Tip:** If you want to change your editor background to a different color, change the _Normal text_ file element's background/foreground to your desired colors. Then, leave all other file elements' backgrounds to _Default_, unless you want certain backgrounds changed such as _Comments_ or _Data/CARDS lines_.
