## Preferences

SAS has a counterintuitive way of saving some of your session settings. Instead of the more common _Apply_ or _Save_, you have to follow these steps.

1. [Customize your window states](layout.md) to how you want them

2. **Tools** > **Options** > **Preferences...**

The _Preferences_ window will appear.

3. Check _Save settings on exit_

4. **OK**

5. Exit SAS

6. Start SAS

7. Go back into _Preferences_ and uncheck _Save settings on exit_

If you don't uncheck the box, your SAS will always save the current window states on exit.
