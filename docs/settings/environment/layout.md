## Explorer

The default _Explorer_ layout isn't ideal for navigating between programs and datasets quickly. This is how it appears in a new session. See below for recommended settings.

### Tree

Click on the _Explorer_ window to activate it.

**View** > **Show Tree**

### Favorite Folders

After showing the tree, right click _Favorite Folders_ > **New Favorite Folder...**

### Icon View

**View** > **Small Icons**

Feel free to try the other few options, but the default _Large Icons_ can get fairly congested.

### Outcome

Preserve these changes across sessions by [saving settings.](saving-settings.md) Now you'll be able to easily navigate between project libraries, work datasets, and other projects.

## Window Layout

There are five main windows that we use frequently (Explorer, Enhanced Editor, Log, VIEWTABLE, and Output). After updating them to the desired configuration, size, and position, you can preserve their state across sessions by [saving settings.](saving-settings.md)
