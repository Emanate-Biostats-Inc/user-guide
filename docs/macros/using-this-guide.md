Macros are divided into the different categories in the sidebar. The documentation pages use this general template. However, there may be some unique topics that deviate from this layout.

## Macro Name

Subheader shows compatible studies and the creator (with mail link).

## Description

Description of the macro's purpose, summary of what it does, etc...

## Defintion

The macro's definition showing all the default parameters

## Parameters

Lists all mandatory parameters with a short description.

## Optional Parameters

Lists all optional parameters with a short description. In order to call these, you must set the optional parameter to an argument (e.g., optParam = arg1)

## Example(s)

Example will default to show the best way to fully utilize the macroâ€™s features (e.g., code snippets in addition to the macro call). Assume running the project's init is always a prerequisite to calling a macro. Other ambiguous prerequisites will be part of the example.

## Outcome

Lists all outcomes of calling the macro that the programmer should utilize (such as macro variables or a log report). Outcomes with a corresponding screenshot will always be listed last.
